# TitleGenerator
Finding a fitting and interesting title for a sci-entific paper can be difficult.  While the tasksof paper-to-abstract and paper-to-review gener-ation are active fields of research, the problemof generating a title from an abstract is - to ourcurrent knowledge - not tackled yet. In this pa-per, we propose a method to generate a set oftitles, given an abstract, with the aim to inspirethe  author  with  different  ideas  for  well  read-able titles. While the idea is to generate overall“good” titles, our focus lies on presenting dif-ferent styles and not necessarily correct titles.Our models are based on OpenAI’s GPT-2 ar-chitecture  which  shows,  among  others,  great capabilities in summarization tasks.

Data crawling is implemented in data crawling 1 and data crawling 2.
